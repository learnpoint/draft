                        <h3>Arrays in JavaScript</h3>
                        <p>
                            An array in JavaScript is a type of global object that is used to store data. Arrays consist
                            of an ordered collection or list containing zero or more data types, and use numbered
                            indices starting from 0 to access specific items.

                        <p>Arrays are very useful as they store multiple values in a single variable, which can condense
                            and organize our code, making it more readable and maintainable. Arrays can contain any data
                            type, including numbers, strings, and objects.
                        </p>
                        <p>To demonstrate how arrays can be useful, consider assigning the five oceans of the world to
                            their own variables.</p>
                        </p>

                        <p>A JavaScript array has the following characteristics:

                            First, an array can hold values of mixed types. For example, you can have an array that
                            stores
                            elements with the types number, string, boolean, and null.
                            Second, the size of an array is dynamic and auto-growing. In other words, you donâ€™t need to
                            specify the array size up front.

                        </p>
                        <h3>Loop through array</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are many ways to loop through an array but we are going to discuss the most common
                            ways to loop through an array.

                            We are going to discuss 2 different ways to loop through an array:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Using for loop
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Using forEach loop
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        </p>
                    </div>
