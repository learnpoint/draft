                    <p>Introduction
                        An array in JavaScript is a type of global object that is used to store data. Arrays consist of an ordered collection or list containing zero or more data types, and use numbered indices starting from 0 to access specific items.
                        
                        <p>Arrays are very useful as they store multiple values in a single variable, which can condense and organize our code, making it more readable and maintainable. Arrays can contain any data type, including numbers, strings, and objects.
                        </p>
                        <p>To demonstrate how arrays can be useful, consider assigning the five oceans of the world to their own variables.</p>
                    </p>
                    <p>A JavaScript array has the following characteristics:

                        First, an array can hold values of mixed types. For example, you can have an array that stores
                        elements with the types number, string, boolean, and null.
                        Second, the size of an array is dynamic and auto-growing. In other words, you donâ€™t need to
                        specify the array size up front.
                        Creating JavaScript arrays
                        JavaScript provides you with two ways to create an array. The first one is to use the Array
                        constructor as follows:</p>

                    <button class="button" data-element="modal-close-button">Avbryt</button>
